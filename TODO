# Todo List for [Fiscalismia Backend]

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Prio
- check my node_env isnt working on demo container and where the env var is
- Evaluate if ssl can be used for demo development database setting ssl = true

### Medium Prio
- Limit access to Admin Panel Menu to jwt-session token content via backend check
- Rethink localbrowser storage evaluation, especially in regards to loginUserName, to prohibit forgery
- Add POST Route for Variable Expenses Staging
- Add Supertest for evaluation of this post route and the ETL process

### Low Prio
### Before Deploying
- Rethink public folder storage for production env -> Persistence with backup / HA
- reenable snyk static code analysis & dependency analysis and fix blatant security errors
- - Replace all SQL interpolation code with parameterized queries which automatically sanitize for SQL Injection

### Post Deployment
- check the `app.set('trust proxy', 1) setting` in production by hitting the api/ip endpoint to find out of the ip address of the X-Forwarded-For header matches the actual ip address or that of a reverse proxy or load balancer
