# Todo List for [Fiscalismia Backend]

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Prio
- Evaluate if ssl can be used for local development database setting ssl = true

### Medium Prio
- check HTTP Security Headers and verify against best practices by running "curl -I https://backend.demo.fiscalismia.com"
- Integrate BACKEND_VERSION env var into health check and set default to "local-development"
- Add POST Route for Variable Expenses Staging and think about how to trigger and evaluate ETL process
- Add Supertest for evaluation of this post route and the ETL process

### Low Prio
### Before Deploying
- Rethink public folder storage for production env -> Persistence with backup / HA
- reenable snyk static code analysis & dependency analysis and fix blatant security errors
- - Replace all SQL interpolation code with parameterized queries which automatically sanitize for SQL Injection

### Post Deployment
- check the `app.set('trust proxy', 1) setting` in production by hitting the api/ip endpoint to find out of the ip address of the X-Forwarded-For header matches the actual ip address or that of a reverse proxy or load balancer
